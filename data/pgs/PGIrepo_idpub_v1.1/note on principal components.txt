Population stratification can bias the estimated association between the outcome of interest and the polygenic index. This will happen when there are differences in the distribution of the index across ancestry groups. Controlling for either the top 10 or top 20 principal components of the covariance matrix of the individuals’ genotypic data is a common way to account for population stratification. For that reason the indices are distributed together with principal components. However, since principal components can reveal fine grain ancestry of WLS pariticipants, they have been randomly shuffled in sets of 5. Users must either include principal components 1-5, 1-10, 1-15 or 1-20 in their analysis to control for population stratification.
